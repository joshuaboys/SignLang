# Learning Auslan with AI

The goal of this project is to build a solution that supports people on their journey to learning the Australian Sign Language, or [Auslan](http://www.auslan.org.au/).

We are looking to leverage the power of modern cloud services such as the [Microsoft Azure Custom Vision API](https://customvision.ai/) to enable at-scale deployment, with a range of potential clients that cover everyday consumer mobile use along with future deployment scenarios utilising augmented reality technologies.

As of August 2018 we are in the early planning stages of this initiative and welcome contributors to join us.
